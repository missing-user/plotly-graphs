# Interactive Plots

Here are the interactive versions of the plots for the CDPR analysis. Toggle the individual graph elements by clicking on the legend items on the right.

quiver\_ files visualize the error between optical tracking and the robots reported position. There is always a variant with the scaling factor applied (scaled) and without the scaling factor (unscaled). 

traj\_ files visualize the trajectory of the robot. On the right, there is error plot over time.

incl\_ files are raw data from the inclination sensor over time.
